			<h3>Loops</h3>
                <p>When you have a repetitive task, it might better to use a loop. Programming loops are all to do with doing the same thing over and over again, which is termed iteration in programming speak.</p>

                <h4 class="newHead">A loop usually has one or more of the following features:
                </h4>

                <dl>
                    <dt>A counter</dt>
                    <dd>This will generally increments the counter by one. It is initialized with a certain value — this is the starting point of the loop .</dd>
                    
                    <dt> A condition </dt>

                    <dd>A condition which is a true/false test to determine whether the loop continues to run, or stops — usually when the counter reaches a certain value. </dd>
                    <dt>An Iterator</dt>
                    <dd>An Iterator will generally increments the counter by a small amount on each successive loop until the condition is no longer true. </dd>
                </dl>
